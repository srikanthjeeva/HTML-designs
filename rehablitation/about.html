                                    Yahoo Rehab is a premier rehabilitation facility where clients are treated with care and concern. It was established in 2002, as a 12-bed facility.

                                    In a country with few treatment facilities and a lack of guidelines and prescribed standards, Yahoo Rehab has pioneered and benchmarked standards and protocols.

                                    Yahoo Rehab has been rated among the TOP 4 rehabs in India by Reader’s Digest (July 2007). Yahoo Rehab’s model is based on the famed ‘Minnesota Model’ initiated in USA. The treatment aims at total abstinence achieved through the Twelve Steps program. The 12-Steps treatment model has been approved by WHO (World Health Organization) as the ‘most effective treatment for addictions’.

                                    A substantial number of the therapy team consists of recovering alcoholics and addicts: those who have travelled the road, experienced the pain of addiction and the joys of recovery. This lends an unmatched touch of empathy and identification to the therapy process

                                    Hope Trust ensures its staff is up-to-date and highly motivated. The staff members attend regular in-house continued skills-development programs.  Several members are enrolled in online educational programs, leading to international certification by IC&RC (International Certification & Reciprocity Consortium) and CACCF (Canadian Addiction Counselors Certification Federation).

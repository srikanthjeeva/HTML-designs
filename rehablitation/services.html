                                    Yahoo Rehab is a premier rehabilitation facility where clients are treated with care and concern. It was established in 2002, as a 12-bed facility. Today, it has grown to 30 beds for men and women housed in two facilities. Yahoo Rehab has earned an international reputation for its commitment, ethical standards and professional approach toward effective treatment of addictions.

                                    In a country with few treatment facilities and a lack of guidelines and prescribed standards, Yahoo Rehab has pioneered and benchmarked standards and protocols.

                                    Yahoo Rehab has been rated among the TOP 4 rehabs in India by Reader’s Digest (July 2007). Yahoo Rehab’s model is based on the famed ‘Minnesota Model’ initiated in USA. The treatment aims at total abstinence achieved through the Twelve Steps program. The 12-Steps treatment model has been approved by WHO (World Health Organization) as the ‘most effective treatment for addictions’.

                                    A substantial number of the therapy team consists of recovering alcoholics and addicts: those who have travelled the road, experienced the pain of addiction and the joys of recovery. This lends an unmatched touch of empathy and identification to the therapy process

                                    Hope Trust ensures its staff is up-to-date and highly motivated. The staff members attend regular in-house continued skills-development programs.  Several members are enrolled in online educational programs, leading to international certification by IC&RC (International Certification & Reciprocity Consortium) and CACCF (Canadian Addiction Counselors Certification Federation).

                                    Alcohol intervention is a process that helps an individual who has problems with alcohol recognize the extent of their situation. Those who have a problem with alcohol usually do not know they are out of control. They look at their alcohol-using peers/friends and their own use appears normal in comparison. They need objective feedback on their behavior. Through a non-judgmental, non-critical, systematic process, the individual is confronted with the impact of their alcohol abuse. The goal of alcohol intervention is for them to accept the reality of their problem and to seek help.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    An alcohol intervention is a difficult and delicate matter. It is very important that they be done properly. No alcohol intervention should be undertaken without advice and counsel of a professional experienced in the alcohol intervention process. Furthermore, since people embarking on an alcohol intervention often feel ambivalent and apprehensive, it is important that they trust the interventionist

                                    Meetings can complement and extend the effects of professional drug addiction treatment. The most prominent meetings for those recovering from drug addiction are those affiliated with Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, and Cocaine Anonymous, all of which are based on the 12-step model. There are other groups who provide meetings such as Smart Recovery and others not based on the 12 steps. Most drug addiction treatment programs encourage patients to participate in meetings to solidify the recovery process during and after formal treatment.
                                </p><p>
                                    Meetings many times are free of charge, self-governing and self-supporting. Information regarding day, time, and locations of meetings held by 12-Step organizations can be found by calling a central group telephone number in the yellow pages under "Alcoholism" and "Drug Abuse and Addiction". Typically meetings are held one or more times a week, at the same location and at the same time. Meetings focus on members sharing with other members their experience, strength, and hope in terms of recovery from alcoholism and drug addiction.
